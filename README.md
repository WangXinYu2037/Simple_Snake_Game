### Simple Snake Game baseing C++ and Cmake

The most of code comes from the 《full course reader》 of Keith Schwarz Stanford University.

I really learn much from this e-book especially about **Multi-file Program** now.

This book is suitable for C++ beginner just like me, and I decide to continue improving this simple project.

Every try triggered from my idea makes me more  skilled at C++ programming.
